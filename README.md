### Description:

AquaCraft: Integrative 3D Modeling of a Real-World Vessel Utilizing RhinoCeros and SolidWorks, encompassing the Generation of Essential 3D Print Files with Requisite Mesh Structures, alongside Hydrodynamic Analysis via MaxSurf.

This project was done under super vision of Prof. M. Saeed Seif, Sharif University of Technology by Amin Hashemi.

## Features

- **3D Model:** The SolidWorks/RhinoCeros model includes accurate dimensions and features, capturing the essence of a real world ship.
- **3D print Compatible:** I've created the `.stl` file compatible for 3D printing for educational purposes.
- **Offset-table:** The offset table of real ship, was extracted from the 3d design in SolidWorks.
- **3-view Plans:** The 3-view plans of real ship, was extracted from the 3d design in SolidWorks.
- **Hydrodynamical Analysis:** The design was imported into MaxSurf and was analyzed hydrodynamically with meaningful numbers.
